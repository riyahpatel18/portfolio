										<h1>About Me</h1>
									</header>
									
									<header>
										<p>I'm a data enthusiast with a passion for transforming complex information into actionable insights. With a strong educational foundation from my Master's program and proficiency in Excel, Tableau, and SQL, I approach each data challenge with both technical expertise and creative problem-solving skills. I enjoy identifying patterns, extracting meaningful insights, and presenting data in compelling visualizations that tell a story.
				
											</p>
										<p> <!--- My technical toolkit also includes knowledge of Python, R, and Java—skills I acquired during my graduate studies and am eager to apply in professional settings.--> 
										</p><p>
											Intellectually curious by nature, I thrive on solving complex problems and uncovering insights that others might miss. This drive fuels my continuous learning and allows me to approach challenges with enthusiasm and persistence.
										</p>
										<p>Beyond the data world, my analytical mindset extends to my personal interests. You can find me solving escape rooms on weekends or watching crime shows, appreciating how investigators use similar analytical methods to connect evidence and solve cases—both data analysis and detective work require attention to detail, pattern recognition, and logical reasoning to uncover hidden truths.
										</p>

										<p>I bring this combination of technical skills, academic knowledge, and analytical thinking to every project, always eager to dive into data and discover the solutions hidden within the numbers. ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​I created this portfolio to showcase personal projects I am working on to practice and improve my technical skills!
										</p>

										
											<!--<p>I am an Operations Consultant based in Charlotte, NC, pursuing a career in Data Analytics & Reporting. I enjoy hanging out with my friends and family, solving escape rooms, dancing, and watching TV.</p>

											<p> I attended the University of Florida and pursued a BSBA, majoring in Information Systems. At the end of my sophomore year, I applied to UF's Combined Degree Program, which allowed me to start working towards my MS in Information Systems & Operations Management. The MSISOM program introduced me to the Association for Information Systems (AIS), a student run organization for MS-ISOM students. In AIS, we had a consulting committee where we would provide pro bono consulting to nonprofits, government orgs, and small businesses around North Florida. This was my first introduction to solving real business problems. I really enjoyed getting to work with clients in our community and help them using my technical skills.
											</p>
											<p> My favorite TV genre has always been police and detective shows. Two of my favorite shows to watch growing up were NCIS and Castle. I was always fascinated watching investigators gather data (clues, evidence, testimonies) and use analysis methods (pattern recognition) to solve problems (cases). Similarly, solving escape rooms also require the use of critical thinking and being observant to find clues, piece information together, and find solutions. 
												<br></p>
												Through my work experience and education, I have been able to apply those same skills as well as technical skills to leverage data for solving business problems and influencing decision making. </p>


											 <p> During my time in college, I was in an organization called Association for Information Systems. In this organization, we had a consulting branch where we provided pro bono consulting  </p>

										 <h3>Relevant Work Experience</h3> 				
										
										 
										 <strong>AVP, Process Design Consultant  </strong> |  <a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/"  target="_blank"class="label">Bank of America</a><br>								
										 <p>Second rotation of the Global Operations Development Program (GODP) in Global Treasury & Merchant Operations. I work on the Strategy & Transformation team, supporting a new process and assisting team members with their projects. I am responsible for data analysis, reporting, and documentation of the new process end to end. I have also been able to help manage SharePoint sites and learn dynamic forms.</p>

										 <strong>AVP, Financial Data & Reporting Consultant  </strong> | <a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/" target="_blank" class="label">Bank of America</a><br>							
										 <p>First GODP rotation in Banking Tax Operations. I supported various BAU activities and was responsible for the data management side of the team. Using my technical skills, I identified data gaps in the process I took over on multiple occasions, created remediation plans, and fixed inconsistencies. In addition, I used SQL and Excel to extract data from various systems to create new reports, visualizations, and tax reference data comparisons. </p>

										 <strong> Project Manager/Consulting Analyst </strong> | <a href="https://ufais.org"  target="_blank"class="label">Association for Information Systems</a><br>								
										 <p>We provided pro bono technology consulting services to non-profits, small businesses, and local government orgs in North Florida. My first few projects were website redesign, but as our organization grew, we got more data related projects. After my first semester as an analyst, I became a Project Manager and was responsible for leading business requirement meetings, weekly sprint meetings with my analysts, and routine product review meetings with our client. We created Kanban boards in Trello to write and assign user stories. Every team had a final presentation to their client at the end of each semester. I loved being able to use technology to make an impact on those in my community.</p>

										 <strong>Operations Consultant, Global Operations Development Program Summer Associate </strong> |  <a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/"  target="_blank"class="label">Bank of America</a><br>								
										 <p>I was an intern on the Data Management & Analytics team in the Global Operations Management, Resiliency, & Client Programs subLOB. I learned about the data lifecycle (capture, transport, use, external data transmission) and how data must be timely, accurate, and complete. The projects I worked on aided in ensuring the quality of data, helping to remediate data gaps and uploading evidence to SharePoint to justify rationales.</p>

										 <strong> Data Analyst Intern </strong> | <a href="https://peakactivity.com/"  target="_blank"class="label">PeakActivity</a><br>					 								
										 <p>I started off as a summer intern on the Finance team and was offered the opportunity to continue working part time through the school year. Over the year, I used my data wrangling, analysis, and visualization skills to create financial models, forecasts, reports, Tableau dashboards, and a semi-automated HR database. I also studied for and passed the Tableau Desktop Specialist Certification exam during my time at PeakActivity.  </p>
